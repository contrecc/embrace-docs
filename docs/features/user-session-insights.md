# User Session Insights
Experience every user interaction with real production-level data seamlessly. Embrace captures every user interaction, network request, and crash in real-time, providing you with comprehensive insights into your users' experiences.

## Stitched Sessions List
The stitched sessions list presents a chronological compilation of all user sessions. Sessions are seamlessly stitched together to offer a complete view of the user's journey. You can easily identify sessions with crashes, ANRs (App Not Responding), or network issues, and filter them by user ID, device, app version, and more.

## User Timeline
The user timeline offers a granular view of each user's session, showcasing every interaction, network request, and crash.

### Horizontal Timeline
The horizontal timeline provides an overview of the session, highlighting different events such as network requests, crashes, and user interactions. Hovering over the timeline reveals details of activities at specific times. You can customize your view by filtering out events as per your preference.
