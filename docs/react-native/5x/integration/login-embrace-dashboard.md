# Getting Started with the Embrace Dashboard

## Logging In

Before being able to integrate, you'll need to create an account on the Embrace
dashboard so you can access your app ID and API token. Open a browser and
navigate to [dash.embrace.io](https://dash.embrace.io/).

Either login if you have created an account already, or follow the prompts to
register for a new one.

## Integration page

Once you've finished logging in or registering for a new account, you'll be able
to create a new app. Follow the prompts until you get to the integration page.
Keep this tab open in your browser throughout the integration process. This will
assist you in verifying that data is sent, along with helping you become
familiar with the features the Embrace Dashboard offers.

Take note of the app ID and API token, as you'll need those when integrating the
Embrace SDK with your app.
